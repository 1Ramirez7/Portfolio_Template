If you follow the steps below on adding new files and editing the _quarto.yml your site should always render. I do not focus to much on the QMD details as that is one of the main concepts we have been working on in class. So you can edit the QMD files as you see fit, and as long as they render locally, they will be published to the site.\nThe following are instructions to edit this portfolio separated into sections. Each section is intended to show how to add and or edit different parts of the portfolio.\n\n\nAdding a New Tab\nAdding a new tab to the portfolio. I’m adding a resume.\n\nIn the _quarto.yml file add, under the navbar, and this two lines of code\ntext: \"My Resume\"\nfile: resume.qmd\nAdd/create the resume.qmd file to the root folder\n\nRender the resume.qmd file\n\nUpdate yml links\n\nBuild &gt; render website\n\nPush to GitHub and the site should be updated with your new tab.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a Project Tab with Multiple Files\nStep 1:\nAdding a tab with a sidebar for multiple QMD files\n- Add tab code to navbar and sidebar code to _quarto.yml\nStep 2:\n- Add QMD for the main tab\n- Add a folder with QMD files for the main tab\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Python Code & Environment in R-Studio\nPart 4. Working with Python code, environment, and requirements.txt files in R-Studio\nStep 1: Check what environment is active (likely a global environment)\nlibrary(reticulate)\npy_config()\nStep 1.7: Create a virtual environment if needed (basically needed in any new device)\nlibrary(reticulate)\nvirtualenv_create(\"env\")\nStep 1.5: Load environment for the project if needed. Use the code from Step 1 to make sure the new environment is loaded. If not, use this to load the new environment. Replace env with the actual name of your environment.\nlibrary(reticulate)\nuse_virtualenv(\"env\", required = TRUE)\nStep 2: Install Python libraries\nlibrary(reticulate)\npy_install(c(\"pandas\", \"numpy\", \"matplotlib\"))\nStep 2.1: Run Python code/file and render Python files\nStep 3: Create/update the requirements.txt file\nshell(\"pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
