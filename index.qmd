# Introduction

**Portfolio Introduction**

This portfolio was created as part of the Data Science minor at Brigham Young University, showcasing my skills and experiences in three key areas: Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate the knowledge I have gained throughout the program and how I have applied it to real-world data challenges.
